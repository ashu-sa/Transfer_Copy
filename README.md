# File Sharing App

## Overview
The File Sharing App is a versatile and user-friendly Android application that allows users to seamlessly share files between devices using Wi-Fi Direct (Wifip2p). It simplifies the file-sharing process with the added convenience of QR code scanning for device pairing. Built on the MVVM architecture, this app provides a robust and organized codebase.

## Features

- **Wi-Fi Direct (Wifip2p) Integration:** Utilizing Wi-Fi Direct technology, this app enables direct, high-speed, and secure file transfers between devices without the need for an internet connection.

- **QR Code Scanner:** The integrated QR code scanner simplifies the process of pairing devices. Users can easily scan QR codes displayed on other devices to establish a connection.

- **MVVM Architecture:** The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase by separating business logic from UI components.
